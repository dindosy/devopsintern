# Project CI Pipeline

## Overview

This repository includes a CI pipeline configured using GitHub Actions. The pipeline is designed to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes to ensure a smooth and reliable workflow.

## Functional Requirements

1. Automated Testing
   - All code changes trigger an automated testing process.
   - Unit tests are run as part of the pipeline to ensure code quality.

2. Automated Deployment
   - Upon successful testing, the code is automatically deployed to the staging environment.
   - The deployment process is automated, repeatable, and reliable.

## CI Pipeline

# Workflow Configuration

-Trigger: The pipeline is triggered on `push` or `pull_request` events to the `main` branch.
- Build Step: 
  - The code is checked out, Node.js is set up, dependencies are installed, and the project is built.
  - Automated tests are run to verify the build.
- Deployment Step:
  - If the build and tests are successful, the code is automatically deployed to the staging environment.

# Deployment

- Deployment is configured to run after a successful build.
- Ensure the appropriate deployment script/commands are included to handle the actual deployment process.

# Usage

To trigger the CI/CD pipeline:
1. Push changes to the `main` branch or open a pull request against the `main` branch.
2. The pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the code.
